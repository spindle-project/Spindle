## Reporting Vulnerabilities in Spindle
Spindle takes security seriously and encourages responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities found in the language. Here's how to report a vulnerability:

Where to Go:

Head over to the Spindle project on GitHub: https://github.com/Spindle-project/Spindle. There, you'll find a dedicated section for security issues. Look for the "Security" tab or search for "vulnerability reporting" within the repository.

Expected Response Time:

The Spindle team aims to acknowledge reported vulnerabilities within 72 hours. They'll then work to investigate and assess the severity of the issue.

What to Expect:

Accepted Vulnerability:
You'll be notified that the vulnerability has been confirmed and a timeline for a fix will be provided.
The Spindle team may reach out for further details or clarification about the vulnerability.
Your contribution will be acknowledged in the project's changelog upon release of the fix.
Declined Vulnerability:
You'll receive a response explaining why the reported issue isn't considered a security vulnerability.
The team may offer further explanation or resources if the reported issue is a known bug or limitation.
General Tips:

When reporting a vulnerability, be as detailed as possible. Include steps to reproduce the issue, any error messages encountered, and the version of Spindle you're using.
Avoid publicly disclosing the vulnerability until the Spindle team has had a chance to address it.
If you have any questions or require further clarification on the reporting process, feel free to reach out to the Spindle project maintainers on GitHub.
Remember: Responsible disclosure helps keep Spindle secure for everyone. By following these guidelines, you can play a vital role in maintaining a safe and reliable learning environment.
